Who May Access Your Personal Data</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In addition to COGNOSPHERE and/or its affiliates, other parties may also access your personal data in the following situations. You acknowledge that you have foreseen and agreed to the occurrence of such disclosure when you provide your personal data.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">1) Other Users</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Other users may, for example in a group challenge, see your in-game activities in group challenge. Other users may also see your display data and read the messages you have posted on or through the COGNOSPHERE Services. You confirm that the COGNOSPHERE Services may also include message boards, communities, forums, and/or other chat areas, where users may exchange ideas or communicate with other users and you acknowledge that any data you posted to any communication area is publicly viewable. We strongly recommend that all users avoid posting personal or sensitive data at any time.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">2) Competent Authorities</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">We may provide certain portion of your personal data to judicial or administrative authorities as so requested. Besides, we may disclose certain portion of your personal data within a strictly limited scope of recipients when we reasonably think it is necessary to protect us, our users or a portion of the public.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In addition to be required by applicable laws, we reserve the right to disclose your personal data in the cases if we, in our good faith, believe that disclosing such data is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you, if (a) you are violating any agreements between us, such as the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy or otherwise damage us; (b) you are infringing third parties’ rights and interests (including but not limited to intellectual property rights); and/or (c) we believe that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">3) Third-Party Contractors</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">COGNOSPHERE works with a number of (if any) social media contractors, advertising serving contractors, analyzing contractors, payment service providers, fraud-detection contractors and other third-party contractors on or through our services. We do not sell your personal data and only share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and public data with third parties.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Besides, such contractors may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other tracking technologies to collect or receive data about you and might claim controller rights over your personal data. For example, users purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional data to payment service providers, such as a valid credit card number, expiration date. Such payment service providers may collect, process, retain your data to process payments and resolve subsequent payment disputes and inquiries. We may also receive, process and store the provided information from you and/or such payment service providers to confirm payment, record purchase history and/or protect our legitimate interest when resolving subsequent payment disputes and inquiries.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy policy as we do. Since those contractors may access your data as data controller and operate under their own privacy policies, we strongly encourage you to check their privacy policies on their official websites and learn more about their data processing practices.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; min-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">6.

Our servers are located in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In the case you request to remove or delete your personal data, we will retain your data as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce the agreements between us. Please note that the removal or deletion of any of your data may result in the termination of some of our applicable services.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">We will only store your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information is collected and processed or where the applicable law provides for longer storage and retention period. After that, your personal data will be deleted, blocked or anonymized, as provided by applicable law.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; min-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">7.
